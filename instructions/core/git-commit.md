# Git Commit Workflow

Execute git commit operations with optional Zen MCP precommit validation when executed through PEER.

## Overview

<purpose>
  - Provide a git commit workflow that can be enhanced with MCP validation
  - Enable precommit checks when executed through PEER pattern
  - Maintain backwards compatibility with direct execution
</purpose>

<context>
  - Part of Agent OS git workflow enhancement
  - Works with existing git-workflow agent
  - Integrates with PEER pattern for MCP validation
</context>

## Usage Examples

### Through PEER (recommended for MCP validation):
```bash
# PEER will check MCP availability and run precommit if available
/peer --instruction=git-commit

# With specific commit message
/peer --instruction=git-commit --message="feat: implement user authentication"

# Skip MCP check even if available
/peer --instruction=git-commit --skip-precommit

# Execute a commit plan file
/peer --instruction=git-commit --plan=commit-plan-2025-08-13-17-30.json

# Execute only a specific branch from plan (partial execution)
/peer --instruction=git-commit --plan=commit-plan-2025-08-13-17-30.json --branch=feature/auth

# Resume incomplete commit execution
/peer --instruction=git-commit --continue
```

### Direct execution (bypasses MCP check):
```bash
# Direct execution always skips MCP precommit
/git-commit --message="fix: resolve login issue"
```

## Process Flow

  EXECUTE: @~/.agent-os/instructions/meta/pre-flight.md
</pre_flight_check>

  <step number="1" name="parse_arguments">
    
    ### Step 1: Parse Arguments
    
    <argument_parsing>
      PARSE command arguments:
        - --message=<text>: Commit message (optional)
        - --skip-precommit: Skip MCP validation even if available
        - --plan=<filename>: Execute commit plan file (optional)
        - --continue: Resume incomplete execution from NATS KV state (optional)
        - --branch=<branch-name>: Execute only specified branch from plan (optional)
        
      VALIDATE arguments:
        - --plan and --continue are mutually exclusive
        - If --plan provided, file must exist in .agent-os/commit-plan/
        - If --branch provided, --plan must also be provided
        - --branch and --continue are mutually exclusive

## Integration with PEER

When executed through PEER (`/peer --instruction=git-commit`), the PEER executor adds:

1. **Pre-execution Phase**: 
   - Checks for mcp__zen tools availability
   - Runs mcp__zen__precommit if available
   - Shows validation results to user
   - Awaits user decision to proceed

2. **Execution Phase**:
   - Delegates to this instruction
   - Passes validation context
   - Handles user interactions

3. **Review Phase**:
   - Captures validation patterns
   - Documents any issues for future reference

## Plan Adherence Requirements

**CRITICAL**: When executing git-commit through PEER with commit plans, the following requirements are inviolable:

### Plan Immutability
- Commit plans represent approved execution sequences that MUST NOT be modified autonomously
- All plan steps, file specifications, commit messages, and branch targeting are binding
- Any deviations from the plan require explicit user confirmation
- Subagents MUST NOT make independent decisions about plan modifications

### Execution Constraints
- File staging MUST match exactly what is specified in the plan
- Commit messages MUST use the exact text from the plan specification
- Branch creation and switching MUST follow plan sequencing exactly
- No additional files may be staged beyond plan requirements
- No additional commits may be created beyond plan specifications

### Deviation Handling
- ALL deviations from the plan MUST trigger immediate execution halt
- Users MUST be presented with clear deviation details and impact assessment
- Execution may only continue after explicit user confirmation of deviation
- Deviations MUST be recorded in NATS KV state for audit purposes

### MCP Context Isolation
- MCP validation MUST receive only files relevant to the current commit
- MCP MUST NOT receive the entire plan context or unrelated files
- Each commit in a multi-commit plan MUST be validated independently
- MCP context isolation prevents over-validation and maintains plan integrity

### Subagent Constraints
- All delegated agents receive explicit constraints preventing autonomous plan modifications
- Subagents MUST report unexpected conditions rather than making assumptions
- No subagent may stage, commit, or branch beyond explicit plan specifications
- All subagent operations MUST align with plan adherence requirements

### Failure Recovery
- Plan execution failures MUST preserve partial progress in NATS KV state
- Resume functionality MUST maintain plan adherence for remaining steps
- Conflict resolution MUST not violate plan specifications
- Recovery operations MUST undergo deviation detection before proceeding

## Arguments Reference

### --message
- **Type**: String
- **Required**: No
- **Description**: Commit message to use. If not provided, git-workflow will prompt
- **Example**: `--message="feat: add user authentication"`

### --skip-precommit
- **Type**: Boolean flag
- **Required**: No
- **Description**: Skip MCP precommit validation even when available through PEER
- **Example**: `--skip-precommit`

### --plan
- **Type**: String (filename)
- **Required**: No (mutually exclusive with --continue)
- **Description**: Execute commit plan file from .agent-os/commit-plan/ directory
- **Validation**: File must exist and conform to commit-plan-schema.md
- **Example**: `--plan=commit-plan-2025-08-13-17-30.json`

### --continue
- **Type**: Boolean flag
- **Required**: No (mutually exclusive with --plan and --branch)
- **Description**: Resume incomplete git commit execution from NATS KV state
- **Behavior**: Searches for incomplete executions and prompts user to select
- **Example**: `--continue`

### --branch
- **Type**: String (branch name)
- **Required**: No (requires --plan to be provided)
- **Description**: Execute only the specified branch from the commit plan (partial execution)
- **Validation**: Branch name must exist in the provided plan file
- **Behavior**: Sets execution to partial mode, restores original files after completion
- **Example**: `--branch=feature/authentication`

## Notes

- This instruction provides both standard and enhanced git commit workflows
- **Standard Mode**: Acts as thin wrapper for git-workflow (existing behavior)
- **Enhanced Mode**: Supports commit plan execution and resume capability
- MCP validation only occurs when executed through PEER
- Direct execution provides standard git workflow without validation
- Plan execution uses NATS KV for state persistence and resume capability
- Multi-branch execution includes conflict detection and user decision prompts
- All git operations are ultimately handled by the git-workflow agent
- NATS KV state provides audit trail for complex commit workflows
- Enhanced features maintain backward compatibility with existing usage patterns
