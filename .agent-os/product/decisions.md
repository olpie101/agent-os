## 2025-08-13: Agent OS Multi-Agent PEER Pattern Architecture

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Technical Architect, Development Team

### Decision

Agent OS implements a multi-agent orchestration system based on the PEER (Plan, Execute, Express, Review) pattern with NATS KV for persistent state management, enabling reliable task continuation and coordinated multi-agent workflows for AI-assisted development.

### Context

Traditional AI coding agents suffer from context loss, inconsistent behavior, and inability to handle complex multi-step tasks reliably. The need for predictable, continuable AI assistance drove the development of a structured approach that could preserve context, coordinate multiple specialized agents, and provide consistent outcomes.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Single Monolithic Agent**
   - Pros: Simpler architecture, fewer coordination challenges
   - Cons: Context limitations, no role specialization, difficult error recovery

2. **Stateless Multi-Agent System**
   - Pros: Simpler deployment, no state management complexity
   - Cons: No continuation support, context loss between sessions

3. **Database-Based State Management**
   - Pros: Mature tooling, SQL capabilities, ACID guarantees
   - Cons: Additional infrastructure, slower for frequent updates, more complex setup

### Rationale

NATS KV provides lightweight, fast state management with built-in replication and history, perfect for agent coordination. The PEER pattern naturally decomposes complex tasks into manageable phases with clear handoff points. Multi-agent architecture allows specialization while maintaining coordination through shared state.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Reliable task continuation across sessions
- Predictable agent behavior through structured workflows
- Specialized agents with clear responsibilities
- Persistent state enables learning and optimization
- NATS infrastructure is lightweight and performant

**Negative:**
- Additional infrastructure dependency (NATS server)
- More complex debugging across multiple agents
- Learning curve for PEER pattern adoption

## 2025-08-13: NATS KV for State Management

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Technical Architect, Development Team

### Decision

Use NATS KV (Key-Value store) as the primary state management system for Agent OS, implementing a unified state schema with JSON documents stored at cycle-specific keys.

### Context

Agent coordination requires reliable, fast state sharing with history tracking and conflict resolution. The system needed to support concurrent access patterns, versioning, and efficient reads/writes for state updates.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **File-based State**
   - Pros: No external dependencies, simple debugging
   - Cons: No concurrent access, no replication, manual conflict resolution

2. **Redis**
   - Pros: Fast, mature, good tooling
   - Cons: Additional infrastructure, no built-in messaging, separate replication setup

3. **PostgreSQL JSON**
   - Pros: ACID guarantees, mature tooling, SQL capabilities
   - Cons: Heavier infrastructure, slower for frequent updates, overkill for key-value patterns

### Rationale

NATS KV provides the perfect balance of performance, reliability, and simplicity for agent state management. Built-in replication, history tracking, and atomic operations eliminate the need for complex coordination protocols. Integration with NATS messaging provides future extensibility.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Fast state reads/writes with microsecond latency
- Built-in replication and fault tolerance
- History tracking enables debugging and rollback
- Atomic operations prevent state corruption
- Single infrastructure component serves multiple needs

**Negative:**
- Requires NATS server deployment and management
- Learning curve for NATS-specific operations
- JSON document size limits (typically 1MB)

## 2025-08-13: Shell Script Implementation Strategy

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Development Team

### Decision

Implement Agent OS infrastructure using shell scripts (Bash) with jq for JSON manipulation, prioritizing simplicity, portability, and minimal dependencies over performance optimization.

### Context

The system needed to be lightweight, easy to debug, and work across different development environments without complex dependency management. Infrastructure scripts require reliable JSON processing and error handling.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Go Implementation**
   - Pros: Better performance, type safety, single binary distribution
   - Cons: Compilation requirements, larger codebase, development overhead

2. **Python Implementation**
   - Pros: Rich ecosystem, JSON handling, readable code
   - Cons: Dependency management, virtual environments, slower startup

3. **Node.js Implementation**
   - Pros: Native JSON support, async capabilities, NPM ecosystem
   - Cons: Node.js installation requirements, package management complexity

### Rationale

Shell scripts with jq provide the simplest possible implementation that works everywhere Unix tools are available. The performance requirements for agent coordination are modest, and the debugging advantages of shell scripts outweigh performance considerations. This approach minimizes setup friction for new users.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Zero compilation or build steps required
- Universal compatibility with Unix-like systems
- Easy debugging and troubleshooting
- Minimal dependency requirements
- Clear separation of concerns in small, focused scripts

**Negative:**
- Slower execution compared to compiled languages
- Less robust error handling patterns
- Limited data processing capabilities
- Shell script complexity grows non-linearly

## 2025-08-13: Unified State Schema v1.1

**ID:** DEC-004
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Technical Architect, Agent Development Team

### Decision

Implement unified state schema v1.1 with simplified architecture (no optimistic locking), cycle-based storage pattern, and phase ownership rules for coordinating multi-agent workflows.

### Context

Multi-agent coordination requires a clear data contract that prevents conflicts while allowing concurrent access. The system needed to balance consistency with simplicity, avoiding over-engineering while ensuring reliable coordination.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Optimistic Locking with Sequences**
   - Pros: Stronger consistency guarantees, conflict detection
   - Cons: Increased complexity, retry logic, potential for deadlocks

2. **Event Sourcing Pattern**
   - Pros: Complete history, replay capabilities, strong consistency
   - Cons: Significant complexity increase, difficult querying, storage overhead

3. **Phase-Specific State Documents**

### Rationale

Phase ownership rules provide sufficient coordination without the complexity of full locking mechanisms. The simplified v1.1 approach allows rapid development and testing while establishing the foundation for future enhancements. JSON documents in NATS KV provide natural atomic updates at the document level.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Simple read-modify-write patterns are easy to implement
- Clear phase ownership prevents most conflicts
- Unified schema enables cross-phase analysis
