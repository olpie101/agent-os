# Product Mission (Lite)

Agent OS is a multi-agent orchestration system that helps AI coding agents deliver predictable, high-quality results through structured workflows, persistent state management, and the innovative PEER (Plan, Execute, Express, Review) pattern for improved task coordination and continuation reliability.

Agent OS serves developers augmented by AI and technical teams who need reliable, consistent AI assistance for complex coding tasks. Unlike traditional AI coding tools that lose context and produce inconsistent results, Agent OS provides persistent state management through NATS KV and coordinated multi-agent workflows that ensure predictable outcomes and true task continuation support.
