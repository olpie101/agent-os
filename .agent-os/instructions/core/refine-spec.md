# Spec Refinement Rules

## Overview

Refine existing spec documentation based on user requirements, review recommendations, or implementation discoveries while preserving completed work.

<pre_flight_check>
  EXECUTE: @.agent-os/instructions/meta/pre-flight.md
</pre_flight_check>

<process_flow>

<step number="1" subagent="context-fetcher" name="spec_identification">

### Step 1: Spec Identification

Use the context-fetcher subagent to identify which spec to refine by extracting from --spec flag, user input, or finding the most recent spec.

<spec_selection>
  <parameter_check>
    IF --spec flag provided:
      USE: Spec name from --spec parameter
    ELSE IF user mentions specific spec:
      EXTRACT: Spec name from user input
    ELSE IF user asks for "latest" or "most recent":
      FIND: Most recent spec folder by date prefix
    ELSE:
      ERROR: "Please specify which spec to refine"
      STOP execution
  </parameter_check>
</spec_selection>

<spec_validation>
  <folder_check>
    VERIFY: .agent-os/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-[SPEC_NAME] exists
    IF not exists:
      ERROR: "Spec folder not found: [SPEC_PATH]"
      PROVIDE: List of available specs
      STOP execution
  </folder_check>
</spec_validation>

<instructions>
  ACTION: Determine spec to refine
  VALIDATE: Spec folder exists
  STORE: Spec path for subsequent steps
</instructions>

</step>

<step number="2" subagent="context-fetcher" name="load_spec_files">

### Step 2: Load Spec Files and Establish Boundaries

Use the context-fetcher subagent to load all spec files including dynamically discovered sub-specs, and establish strict file modification boundaries.

<required_files>
  - spec.md (main requirements)
  - spec-lite.md (condensed version)
  - technical-spec.md (technical implementation)
  - tasks.md (task breakdown)
</required_files>

<dynamic_loading>
  <sub_specs_scan>
    SCAN: sub-specs/ directory
    FIND: All .md files
    LOAD: Each discovered sub-spec file
    TRACK: Which sub-specs exist (database-schema.md, api-spec.md, etc.)
  </sub_specs_scan>
</dynamic_loading>

<modification_boundaries>
  STORE: SPEC_FOLDER_PATH = .agent-os/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-[SPEC_NAME]/
  
  ALLOWED_MODIFICATIONS:
    - Files within [SPEC_FOLDER_PATH] only
    - Only .md documentation files
    - No implementation files ever
  
  ENFORCEMENT_DIRECTIVE:
    - ALL subsequent file-creator invocations MUST include these constraints
    - ANY attempt to modify files outside SPEC_FOLDER_PATH must be rejected
    - This is a spec refinement - ONLY documentation updates allowed
</modification_boundaries>

<instructions>
  ACTION: Load all spec documentation
  INCLUDE: Dynamically discovered sub-specs
  ESTABLISH: File modification boundaries for all subsequent steps
  STORE: SPEC_FOLDER_PATH for constraint enforcement
  PREPARE: Context for refinement decisions
</instructions>

</step>

<step number="3" name="gather_refinement_requirements">

### Step 3: Gather Refinement Requirements

Analyze the source and nature of refinement needs to understand what changes are required.

<refinement_sources>
  <user_requested>
    - Scope changes
    - Feature additions/removals
    - Priority adjustments
    - Technical approach changes
  </user_requested>
  <review_recommendations>
    - From PEER review phase
    - Quality improvements
    - Completeness issues
    - Clarity enhancements
  </review_recommendations>
  <implementation_discoveries>
    - Technical constraints found
    - Better solutions identified
    - Dependencies discovered
    - Performance considerations
  </implementation_discoveries>
</refinement_sources>

<requirements_analysis>
  IDENTIFY: Type of refinement needed
  ASSESS: Impact on existing documentation
  DETERMINE: Which files need updates
  PRESERVE: Completed work where possible
</requirements_analysis>

<instructions>
  ACTION: Understand refinement requirements
  CLASSIFY: Source and type of changes
  PLAN: Update strategy for each file
</instructions>

</step>

<step number="4" subagent="file-creator" name="update_spec_md">

### Step 4: Update spec.md (Conditional)

Use the file-creator subagent to update spec.md only if requirements or scope changes affect it.

<conditional_execution>
  IF refinement affects requirements, scope, or deliverables:
    UPDATE: spec.md with changes
  ELSE:
    SKIP this step
    PROCEED to step 5
</conditional_execution>

<update_sections>
  <overview>Update if goals/objectives change</overview>
  <user_stories>Modify if user workflows change</user_stories>
  <spec_scope>Add/remove features as needed</spec_scope>
  <out_of_scope>Update exclusions if scope changes</out_of_scope>
  <expected_deliverable>Adjust if outcomes change</expected_deliverable>
</update_sections>

<preservation_rules>
  - Keep unchanged sections intact
  - Preserve formatting and structure
  - Add refinement note if significant changes
</preservation_rules>

<step number="5" subagent="file-creator" name="regenerate_spec_lite">

### Step 5: Regenerate spec-lite.md (Conditional)

Use the file-creator subagent to regenerate spec-lite.md only if spec.md was updated.

<conditional_execution>
  IF spec.md was updated in Step 4:
    REGENERATE: spec-lite.md from updated spec.md
  ELSE:
    SKIP this step

### Step 7: Update Sub-Specs (Conditional)

Use the file-creator subagent to update any sub-specs affected by refinements.

      UPDATE: Relevant sections
    ELSE:
      SKIP: Leave unchanged

  CHECK: No implementation files were modified
</post_step_validation>

</step>

<step number="8" subagent="file-creator" name="update_tasks_md">

### Step 8: Update tasks.md with Preservation Rules

Use the file-creator subagent to update tasks while preserving completed work appropriately.

<task_preservation_rules>

    IF no tasks marked as completed ([x]):
      - Freely modify all tasks
      - Restructure as needed
