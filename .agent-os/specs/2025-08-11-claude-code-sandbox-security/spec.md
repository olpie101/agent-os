## Overview

Refine Claude Code sandbox security configuration to implement principle of least privilege by replacing broad HOME directory access with targeted DEV_WORKSPACE environment variable and creating clear security boundaries for development work.

## User Stories

### Security-Conscious Developer

As a developer using Claude Code, I want the sandbox to have minimal file system access, so that I can trust the AI assistant with sensitive codebases without risking unauthorized access to my entire home directory.

The developer should be able to set a DEV_WORKSPACE environment variable pointing to their active development directory, and Claude Code should only have access to that specific workspace and its subdirectories, preventing access to personal files, SSH keys, browser data, and other sensitive information outside the development context.

### System Administrator

As a system administrator, I want Claude Code sandbox configurations to be parameterized and maintainable, so that security policies can be consistently applied and easily updated across different deployment scenarios.

The configuration should use clear environment variables and parameters that make it easy to audit permissions, update security boundaries, and ensure consistent application of the principle of least privilege across different development environments.

## Spec Scope

1. **Environment Variable Configuration** - Replace hardcoded HOME directory paths with DEV_WORKSPACE environment variable
2. **Principle of Least Privilege Implementation** - Restrict file system access to only necessary development directories
3. **Security Boundary Definition** - Create clear boundaries between development workspace and system/personal files
4. **Parameterized Configuration** - Make sandbox settings configurable through environment variables and parameters
5. **Access Pattern Documentation** - Document what directories and files Claude Code needs access to and why

## Out of Scope

- Changes to Claude Code's core functionality or AI capabilities
- Integration with external security tools or identity management systems
- Encryption or secure communication protocols
- Container orchestration or deployment automation

## Expected Deliverable

1. Updated sandbox configuration that uses DEV_WORKSPACE instead of broad HOME access
2. Documentation of security boundaries and access patterns
3. Configuration parameters that allow customization while maintaining security
4. Verification that all necessary development workflows continue to work within the restricted access model
