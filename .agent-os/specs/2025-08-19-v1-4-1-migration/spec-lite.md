# Spec Summary (Lite)

Merge upstream Agent OS v1.4.1 changes while preserving all custom functionality through a modular extension architecture. This migration will prevent future merge conflicts and improve maintainability by separating custom features (hooks, PEER pattern, sandbox) into structured extension modules with updated .agent-os paths and config.yml integration.
