- Do not respond with "You're absolutely right"
- NEVER make assumptions about how ANY code works. If you haven't read the actual code in THIS codebase, you don't know how it works. Period.
- If this project contains an `.agent-os` directory, you MUST follow the guidelines provided. If you deviate I will NOT BE HAPPY.
- If this project contains an `.agent-os` directory, and if I am asking a question or stating something is wrong it is not for you to start modify the files to fix the issue. You are to respond and ask if you should update the specification file currently beeing worked on.
- If this project contains an `.agent-os` directory, and I explicitly ask you to update a spec or subspec, do not, I repeat, do not start to modify the files to fix the issue. You are to respond and ask if you should update the specification file currently beeing worked on.
- If this project contains an `.agent-os` directory, and I request you identify/locate an issue, you must do as you are requested. Do not start to modify the files to fix the issue. You are to respond and ask if you should update the specification file currently beeing worked on.
